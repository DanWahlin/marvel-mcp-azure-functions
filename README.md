</div>

MCP Server for the [Marvel Developer API](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started), enabling interaction with characters and comics data. *The main goal of the project is to show how an MCP server hosted using Azure Functions can be used to interact with APIs.*

> **Note**: All data used by this MCP server is fetched from the [official Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started) and owned by Marvel. This project is not affiliated with Marvel in any way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Sign up for a [Marvel Developer API](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started) account and get your public and private API keys. 

If you want to the MCP server directly in an MCP host, jump to the [Use with GitHub Copilot](#use-with-github-copilot) or [Use with Claude Desktop](#use-with-claude-desktop) sections.

### Run the Server Locally

1. An Azure Storage Emulator is needed. There are two options:

    - Start Azurite in a Docker container:

      ```bash
      docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 \
          mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
      ```

    - You can use the [Azurite VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=Azurite.azurite). Once the extension is installed, run `Azurite: Start` through the VS Code command palette.

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DanWahlin/marvel-mcp-azure-functions
    ```

1. Rename `.env.template ` to `.env`.

1. Add your Marvel API public and private keys to the `.env` file.

    ```bash
    MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
    MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
    MARVEL_API_BASE=https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public
    ```

1. Install the required dependencies and build the project.

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

1. Start the Azure Functions host locally:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1. (Optional) To try out the MCP server using MCP Inspector, run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Start the MCP Inspector
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
    ```

    Visit the MCP Inspector URL shown in the console in your browser:
    - Change `Transport Type` to `SSE`.
    - Enter `http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse` for the URL.
    - Select `Connect` the button.
    - Select `List Tools`.
    - Select a tool to try it out.

## Configuring an MCP Host

### Use with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marvel-mcp": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```
### Use with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

> **Note**: If you already have the MCP server enabled with Claude Desktop, add `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled: true` in your VS Code settings and it will discover existing MCP server lists.

If you want to associate the MCP server with a specific repo, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with this content:

   ```json
   {
     "inputs": [],
     "servers": {
        "marvel-mcp": {
          "type": "sse",
          "url": "http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse"
        }
     }
   }
   ```

If you want to associate the MCP server with all repos, add the following to your VS Code User Settings JSON:

   ```json
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "marvel-mcp": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse"
      }
    }
  }
   ```

## Deploy to Azure for Remote MCP

Run this [azd](https://aka.ms/azd) command to provision the function app, with any required Azure resources, and deploy your code:

```shell
azd up
```

You can opt-in to a VNet being used in the sample. To do so, do this before `azd up`

```bash
azd env set VNET_ENABLED true
```

Additionally, [API Management]() can be used for improved security and policies over your MCP Server, and [App Service built-in authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) can be used to set up your favorite OAuth provider including Entra.  

### Using Tools in GitHub Copilot

1. Now that the mcp server is discoverable, open GitHub Copilot and select `Agent` mode (not `Ask` or `Edit`).
2. Select the "refresh" button in the Copilot chat text field to refresh the server list.
3. Select the "üõ†Ô∏è" button to see all the possible tools, including the ones from this repo.
4. Put a question in the chat that would naturally invoke one of the tools, for example: 

    ```
    List 10 marvel characters. Include images.

    What comics is Wolverine in?
    
    Which characters appear in the Avengers comics?

    What characters are in the Hedge Knight II: Sworn Sword (2007) comic?
    ```

    > **Note**: If you see "Sorry, the response was filtered by the Responsible AI Service.", try running it again or rephrasing the prompt.
